Computer Architecture class project in UC Merced. 
By Robert Palermo and Ronald Chen.

Implemented a Risc-V instruction decoder in Python.

part1.py can handle translating the following Risc-V instructions:
- lw, sw, add, addi, sub, and, andi, or, ori, beq

part2.py is an extension of part1.py and can handle translating JAL and JALR instructions

part3.py is a pipelined version of part2.py
